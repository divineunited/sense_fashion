# Sense Fashion

*March 20, 2019*

This project will be detecting clothing items that a user wears, describing the items to the user, and then recommending fashion accessories and other clothing items that would look good with what the user is wearing. 

It will also have a database of previous uploaded images that a user has uploaded to keep track of the users different looks.
